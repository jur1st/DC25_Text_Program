# DEF CON 25 Talks in Various Formats

## What's this all about?

I've compiled all of the talk abstracts and speaker bios and I've put them in some useful formats.

## Formats? I love formats. Tell me more!

Do you like Markdown? We've got Markdown. One file for each presentation, evening workshop, and even those folks that have been chosen to fill in at a moments notice if someone else can't make it.

Do you like PDFs? Everyone loves PDFs! Well...at least many of the lawyers I work with do. If you're a really nerdy lawyer that wants to load this all up into Relativity you'll have to write your own load file. Sorry bub. You'll find individual PDFs for each presentation as well as PDFs for each day containing all talks in chron order.

How about Bear? Don't know what Bear is? You should check it out. I used Bear to pull in all of these bios from the DC25 website, apply the tagging, and handle the final conversions to PDF and Markdown. Bear is how I'm going to be using this data next week.

## There aren't enough talks here...where can I find more?

I'm just one man with a hipster text editor, so I've just covered the talks that are happening in the main DEF CON speaking tracks. There are also wonderful talks happening all day in the villiages, they're just not included here. Want to add them? Be my guest. I'll cater to any reasonable pull request.

## How is this different than the Hacker Tracker app or the paper schedule?

Hacker tracker is super cool. Go download a copy. Having spent a little bit of time in the speaking tracks, I know that cell coverage can be a little spotty, and everyone hammering the internets makes the internets less snappy for everyone else. Remember when the carpet caught fire when a phone overheated at the Rio? Yeah...Smokey the Markdown Bear says that only you can prevent carpet fire.

## This is a lot of stuff! Where can I give you some liquid refreshment?

Oh, I'm around but will be more likely to consume adult oriented liquid refreshment after my track closes down every night. If you've got ice cold La Croix (purchased from the hotel of course) you can find me in Track 4.

## Disclaimers

This data is all current as of 2017-07-20 and may or may not be updated prior to the conference. Yes, I'm aware that the formatting for the speaker name and job title is a little wonky. When Bear introduces global find and replace with regular expression support I'll get that fixed. All the copy was taken from the DC25 website a few weeks ago, so typos aren't my fault.
