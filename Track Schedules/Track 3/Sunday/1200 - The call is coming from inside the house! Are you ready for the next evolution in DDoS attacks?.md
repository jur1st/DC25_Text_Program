The second half of 2016 saw the rise of a new generation of IoT botnets consisting of webcams and other IoT devices. These botnets were then subsequently used to launch DDoS attacks on an unprecedented scale against Olympic-affiliated organizations, OVH, the web site of Brian Krebs and Dyn.

Early 2017, a multi-stage Windows Trojan containing code to scan for vulnerable IoT devices and inject them with Mirai bot code was discovered. The number of IoT devices which were previously safely hidden inside corporate perimeters, vastly exceeds those directly accessible from the Internet, allowing for the creation of botnets with unprecedented reach and scale. 

This reveals an evolution in the threat landscape that most organizations are completely unprepared to deal with and will require a fundamental shift in how we defend against DDoS attacks.

This presentation will include:
- An analysis of the Windows Mirai seeder including its design, history, infection vectors and potential evolution.
- The DDoS capabilities of typically infected IoT devices including malicious traffic analysis.
- The consequences of infected IoT devices inside the corporate network including the impact of DDoS attacks, originating from the inside, targeting corporate assets and external resources.
- How to detect, classify and mitigate this new threat.
