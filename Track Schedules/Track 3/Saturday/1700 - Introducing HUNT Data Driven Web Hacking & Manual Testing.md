# 1700 - Introducing HUNT: Data Driven Web Hacking & Manual Testing
Saturday at 17:00 in Track 3
45 minutes | Demo, Tool
### Jason Haddix*Head of Trust and Security @ Bugcrowd*

What if you could super-charge your web hacking? Not through pure automation (since it can miss so much) but through powerful alerts created from real threat intelligence? What if you had a Burp plugin that did this for you? What if that plugin not only told you where to look for vulns but also gave you curated resources for additional exploitation and methodology? What if you could organize your web hacking methodology inside of your tools? Well, now you do! HUNT is a new Burp Suite extension that aims to arm web hackers with parameter level suggestions on where to look for certain classes of vulnerabilities (SQLi, CMDi, LFI/RFI, and more!). This data is parsed from hundreds of real-world assessments, providing the user with the means to effectively root out critical issues. Not only will HUNT help you assess large targets more thoroughly but it also aims to organize common web hacking methodologies right inside of Burp suite. As an open source project, we will go over the data driven design of HUNT and it's core functionality.
