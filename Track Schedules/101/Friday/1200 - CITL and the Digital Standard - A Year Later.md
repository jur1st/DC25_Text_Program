### Sarah Zatko*Chief Scientist, Cyber ITL*

A year ago, Mudge and I introduced the non-profit Cyber ITL at DEF CON and its approach to automated software safety analysis. Now, we'll be covering highlights from the past year's research findings, including our in-depth analysis of several different operating systems, browsers, and IoT products. 

Parts of our methodologies have now been adopted by Consumer Reports and rolled into their Digital Standard for evaluating safety, security, and privacy, in a range of consumer devices. The standard defines important consumer values that must be addressed in product development, with the goal of enabling consumer organizations to test, evaluate, and report on whether new products protect consumer security, safety, and privacy.
