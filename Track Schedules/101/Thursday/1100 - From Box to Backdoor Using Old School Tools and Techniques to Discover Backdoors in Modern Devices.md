### Patrick DeSantis*Senior Security Research Engineer, Cisco Talos*

Stringing together the exploitation of several seemingly uninteresting vulnerabilities can be a fun challenge for security researchers, penetration testers, and malicious attackers. This talk follows some of the paths and thought processes that one researcher followed while evaluating the security of several new "out of the box" Industrial Control System (ICS) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, using a variety of well known exploitation and analysis techniques, and eventually finding undocumented, root-level, and sometimes un-removable, backdoor accounts.
