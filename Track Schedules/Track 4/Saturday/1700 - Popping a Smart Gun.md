# 1700 - Popping a Smart Gun
Saturday at 17:00 in Track 4
45 minutes | Demo, Exploit
### Plore*Hacker*

Smart guns are sold with a promise: they can be fired only by authorized parties. That works in the movies, but what about in real life? In this talk, we explore the security of one of the only smart guns available for sale in the world. Three vulnerabilities will be demonstrated. First, we will show how to make the weapon fire even when separated from its owner by a considerable distance. Second, we will show how to prevent the weapon from firing even when authorized by its owner. Third, we will show how to fire the weapon even when not authorized by its owner, with no prior contact with the specific weapon, and with no modifications to the weapon.
