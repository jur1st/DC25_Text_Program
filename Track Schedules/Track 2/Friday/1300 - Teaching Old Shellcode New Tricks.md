# 1300 - Teaching Old Shellcode New Tricks
Friday at 13:00 in Track 2
45 minutes | Demo
### Josh Pitts*Hacker*

Metasploit x86 shellcode has been defeated by EMET and other techniques not only in exploit payloads but through using those payloads in non-exploit situations (e.g. binary payload generation, PowerShell deployment, etc..). This talk describes taking Metasploit payloads (minus Stephen Fewer's hash API), incorporating techniques to bypass Caller/EAF[+] checks (post ASLR/DEP bypass) and merging those techniques together with automation to make something better.
