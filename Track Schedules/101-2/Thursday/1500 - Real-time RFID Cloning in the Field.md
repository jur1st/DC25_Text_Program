Ever been on a job that required you to clone live RFID credentials? There are many different solutions to cloning RFID in the field and they all work fine, but the process can be slow, tedious, and error prone. What if there was a new way of cloning badges that solved these problems? In this presentation, we will discuss a smarter way for cloning RFID in the field that is vastly more efficient, useful, and just plane cool. We will go over the current tools and methods for long-range RFID cloning, than discuss and demonstrate a new method that will allow you to clone RFID credentials in the field in just seconds, changing the way you perform red team engagements forever.
