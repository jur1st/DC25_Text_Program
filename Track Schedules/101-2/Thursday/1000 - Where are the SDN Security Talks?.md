# 1000 - Where are the SDN Security Talks?
Thursday at 10:00 in 101 Track2
45 minutes | Demo, Tool
### Jon Medina*Protiviti*

Software Defined Networking is no longer a fledgling technology. Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Verizon all rely on the scalability, programmability, flexibility, availability, and yes, security provided by SDN. So why has there only ever been one DEF CON speaker presenting on SDN and security?

This talk will provide a brief introduction to SDN and security, demonstrate ways of compromising and securing a Software Defined Network and will illustrate new ways of using the power of open source SDN coupled with machine learning to maintain self-defending networks.
