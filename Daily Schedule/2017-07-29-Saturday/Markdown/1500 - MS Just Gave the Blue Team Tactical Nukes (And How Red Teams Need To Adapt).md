Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will soon be available for all Blue Teams to utilize within Windows 10 Enterprise, which includes detection of post breach tools, tactics and techniques commonly used by Red Teams, as well as behavior analytics. Combined with Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics for user behavior analytics across the Domain, Red Teamers will soon face a significantly more challenging time maintaining stealth while performing internal recon, lateral movement, and privilege escalation in Windows 10/Active Directory environments.

This talk highlights challenges to red teams posed by Microsoft's new tools based on common hacking tools/techniques, and covers techniques which can be used to bypass, disable, or avoid high severity alerts within Windows Defender ATP and Microsoft ATA, as well as TTP used against mature organizations that may have additional controls in place such as Event Log Forwarding and Sysmon
