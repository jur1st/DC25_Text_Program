Security research is no longer a foreign concept in Washington, DC. A growing number of policymakers are not only thinking about its importance, but are eager to work with hackers to better understand the implications of policy and to help hackers navigate laws that affect security research. Officials from the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, and Congress will talk about how security policy has been evolving; help you understand how you can get involved and make your voice heard; and host an extended Q&A. Hear about everything from making laws more hacker friendly to encryption to IoT security. It's your opportunity to meet the feds and ask them anything.
